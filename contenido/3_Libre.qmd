## Antonio Francesco Gramsci

Born in 1981 – 1937.

Gramsci died on 27 April 1937, at the age of 46

Italian marxist philosopher, linguist, journalist

George Orwell's novel "1984" was published in 1949 (Foucault was 23 years old at that time)

He was part of the italian Communist Party and a vocal critic of Mussolini

He was in prision from 1926 – 1937.

The failure of the workers' councils to develop into a national movement convinced Gramsci that a Communist party in the Leninist sense was needed.

"For twenty years we must stop this brain from functioning."

Gramsci's interest in football dates back to a 16 August 1918 article for the PSI's newspaper Avanti!, titled "Football and Scopone". Fifteen years later, he pointed at the degeneration of stadium cheering, which emerged with the advent of fascism and the consequent nationalisation of the sport that he said extinguished political and trade union commitment. \[https://www.startmag.it/mondo/gramsci-e-togliatti-la-rivoluzione-e-la-juventus/\]

Do Critical Theory and Gramsci have anything in common with Foucault? Gramsci and first generation Critical Theorists were both sympathetic to the workers’ council movement of the 1920s and also accept that our ability to understand the world is rooted in the fact that we also produce that world. This idea goes back to the tradition of Vico and was elaborated in Marx’ and Engels’ German Ideology. It emphasizes, in contrast to Habermas’s misinterpretation of Marx, that such production goes beyond labour to include speaking, governing, having sex, begetting children, struggling and revolting.

Foucault rejected the idea of critical theory as a theory of a social totality

People could be seen as exploited and subordinated not only by the control of their work but also by and through their cultural practices. In the perspective of Walter Benjamin, Bertolt Brecht or Theodor Adorno, culture was the barbarian triumph of the ruling classes – domination includes also the power and the right to define what culture and legitimized knowledge is.

"Ideal Average" on the economic context:

Capitalism: The logic of capital in a capitalist system often prioritizes profit maximization and efficiency. This can lead to inequalities, exploitation, and environmental degradation.

Socialism: In a socialist system, the logic of capital might be modified to prioritize social welfare and equality. However, the concept of capital itself may still exist, albeit in a different form.

Mixed Economy: Many economies combine elements of capitalism and socialism. The "ideal average" would depend on the specific balance between these elements.

Similiaritys between Gramsci's theory of hegemony and Orwell's dystopian novel, 1984.

Cultural hegemony: Both Gramsci and Orwell highlight the importance of cultural control in maintaining power.

Manipulation of language: In both cases, language is used to shape perception and control thought.

Propaganda: Both emphasize the role of propaganda in maintaining the dominant ideology.

Surveillance: Orwell's novel demonstrates how surveillance can be used to enforce conformity and prevent dissent.

### Cultural hegemony today. From cultural studies to critical pedagogy

> Fuente: [@cortés-ramírez2015]

Hegemony is not equal to (….) ideology, consciousness formations of the ruling class are not reduced, but include the relations of domination and subordination, according to (…..) practical consciousness configurations, as an effective saturation of the process of life in full (...) hegemony is a body of practices and expectations regarding the whole of life. Our senses and energy (…..) define perceptions we have of ourselves and our world. It is a vivid system of meanings and values. To the extent they are experienced as practices (they) appear to confirm each other. It is a sense of reality for most people in society (...) (Williams 1977: 109).

As Edward Said has argued in his book Orientalism, the suffering of the people is the direct effect of cultural exchange between partners who are aware of the inequality of this exchange (Said, 1978, p. 95).

Said, E (1993). Culture and Imperialism, London: Chatto & Windus.

The term hegemony derives from the Greek verb eghesthai, meaning "to drive", "to be the guide", "to be the boss"; or maybe from the verb eghemoneno, that means "to guide", "to precede", "to drive", and hence "to stay ahead", "to command", "to rule". At the time of the Peloponnesian War, reference was constantly made to the "hegemonic" city, the town that managed the alliance of Greek cities fighting each other.

For Lenin, the bourgeoisie has always attempted to separate Politics from Economics, because this class understands very well that if it manages to keep the working class within the corporate framework, no serious danger may threaten its hegemony (VVAA, 1969: 20).

Tthe basis of the concept of hegemony was established by the principles defined by Lenin during the Third International. Gramsci emphasized the need of concessions and sacrifices of the proletariat to its allies to be able to exert hegemonic direction over them.

Coercion needs to be accompanied by consent.

Commitment offers important concrete possibilities. Force can be used against enemies, but not against those allied groups that need to be quickly assimilated, and whose good faith, trust and enthusiasm are needed (Gramsci, 1975, p. 62).

It may be that war is the continuation of politics by other means. But it may also be that politics is becoming the continuation of war by other means (Foucault, 1997, pp. 16 and 41; Pandolfi, 2002, pp. 391-410).

## Michel Foucault

1926 – 1984

He was a Frenc historian of ideas an philosofer. Lecturer on Tunis from 1966 to 1968.

He died from complications of HIV/AIDS in Paris. First cases of HIV were discovered in France at 1983 by Pasteur institute. He described himself as a "juvenile delinquent".

I wasn't always smart, I was actually very stupid in school ... \[T\]here was a boy who was very attractive who was even stupider than I was. And to ingratiate myself with this boy who was very beautiful, I began to do his homework for him—and that's how I became smart, I had to do all this work to just keep ahead of him a little bit, to help him. In a sense, all the rest of my life I've been trying to do intellectual things that would attract beautiful boys.

— Michel Foucault, 1983\[27\]
